# Pokedex
- A pokedex-type app to search information on your favorite pok√©mon
- Intended to practice SCSS skills & API usage inside a front-end only framework
- Includes auto-complete search bar
- Built with HTML, SCSS & vanilla JS. w/ Webpack.

Maintenance update (September 2021) - I noticed the API for pokemon main images is down, on a TODO list to fix.
